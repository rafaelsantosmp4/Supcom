# Problem â›”
SUPCOM is a capstone project developed for my TCC in Information Technology, designed to address a significant challenge in B2B communication. Many small retailers struggle to find reliable suppliers, leading to inefficiencies and delays in maintaining their supply chains. The lack of a centralized platform for connecting retailers with potential suppliers often results in missed opportunities and hampers business growth.

# Solution â™»
To solve this problem, SUPCOM offers a comprehensive communication platform that bridges the gap between retailers and suppliers. Our platform features integrated chat systems, product listings, and user profiles, allowing retailers to easily discover new suppliers and establish direct communication channels. By centralizing these interactions, SUPCOM streamlines the process of sourcing products, enabling more efficient operations and fostering stronger business relationships.
